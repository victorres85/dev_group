# DEV COMMUNITY
This has certainly been the biggest sole project I have been working so far, and I am very proud of the result. I have learned a lot about the technologies I used, and I am very happy with the result. I hope you like it too!

This project is still in development, and I am planning to add more features in the future. 

```
    I am constantly looking for ways to improve my skills and learn new things. If you see any mistakes or have any suggestions, please let me know. I would be very grateful for your feedback.

## Project Aim
The aim of this project is to bring together developers which work for different companies under the same group. This way, they can share their knowledge, ask questions, and help each other.

This idea came to me when I working on company which had a small development team within was part of a bigger group. Most of us had no contact with each other, I thought it would be nice to have a platform where we could share our knowledge, the projects we were working on, and ask for help when needed, bringing us closer together.
