# NEO4J

## Introduction to Neo4j
Neo4j is a highly scalable and powerful graph database that stores and processes data in the form of nodes and relationships. Unlike traditional relational databases, Neo4j is optimized for working with connected data and is well-suited for scenarios where relationships between data points are crucial.

In Neo4j, data is organized into nodes, which represent entities, and relationships, which represent connections between entities. Each node and relationship can have properties that store data associated with them.

### Step 1: Installation and Setup
Install Neo4j: Visit https://neo4j.com/download/ and download the appropriate version for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided.

Start Neo4j: After installation, start the Neo4j database. Depending on your installation, this might involve running a command or starting a service.

Access Neo4j Browser: Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:7474. This is the Neo4j Browser, a web-based tool for interacting with the database.

### Step 2: Creating Nodes
Open Neo4j Browser: In the Neo4j Browser, you'll be prompted to set a new password. Follow the instructions to set a password.

Creating Nodes: To create nodes, use the CREATE statement followed by the node's properties. For example, let's create a node representing a person:


```
CREATE (:Person {name: 'John', age: 30})
This command creates a Person node with properties name and age.
```

### Step 3: Querying Nodes
Basic Node Query: To retrieve nodes, use the MATCH statement followed by a pattern that describes the nodes you're looking for. For example, to retrieve all Person nodes:


```
MATCH (p:Person)
RETURN p
```
This query matches all nodes with the Person label and returns them.

Filtering Nodes: You can filter nodes based on their properties. For example, to find all Person nodes older than 25:


```
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.age > 25
RETURN p
```
Combining Filters: You can combine multiple filters. For instance, to find Person nodes named 'John' and older than 25:

```
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name = 'John' AND p.age > 25
RETURN p
```

### Step 4: Advanced Queries
Creating Relationships: Nodes are connected via relationships. To create a relationship between two nodes:


```
MATCH (person:Person {name: 'John'}), (friend:Person {name: 'Alice'})
```

CREATE (person)-[:FRIEND]->(friend)
This creates a FRIEND relationship between John and Alice.

Querying Relationships: To retrieve nodes and their relationships, use the MATCH statement with the relationship. For example, to find John's friends:

```
MATCH (person:Person {name: 'John'})-[:FRIEND]->(friend)
RETURN person, friend
```

Traversing Paths: Neo4j allows traversing paths through relationships. For example, to find friends of friends of John:

```
MATCH (person:Person {name: 'John'})-[:FRIEND]->()-[:FRIEND]->(fof)
RETURN DISTINCT fof
```
